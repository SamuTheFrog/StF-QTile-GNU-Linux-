        OS: x86_64 Arch Linux
        WM: QTile

        Shell: Fish
  -= RECOMMENDED =-
        picom (for rendering effects and transitions, gpu recommended)
        nitrogen (set and load wallpaper, GPU recommended)

# -= Instructions =-
  archQzen is divided into two main branches; Desktop & Mobile
    Desktop was made with no restraints, and should only be used on a Desktop PC with an active primary GPU.
    Mobile was made with power saving & a laptop input scheme in mind. It was also made being even more lightweight than the desktop branch, electing to drop picom & nitrogen.
